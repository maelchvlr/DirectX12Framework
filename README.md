# DirectX12FrameworkV2
 Little Engine running under DX12 API to load scenes and shaders

I'm a student, studying vido game programming and Graphic Programming, this is basically my attempt at understanding DX12 and how to use it, it will most likely not be perfect, but we have to start somewhere right ?
